# Student Feedback Sentiment Analysis 

This project utilizes Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to transform raw student feedback data into actionable institutional intelligence. By analyzing various metrics of academic performance, we identify key strengths and critical areas for improvement within the campus environment.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to move beyond subjective guesswork and use evidence-based decision-making to improve student satisfaction. We processed long-form survey questions into concise metrics such as:
* **Knowledge** (Subject expertise)
* **Understandability** (Clarity of concepts)
* **Support** (Student assistance)
* **Structuring** (Course organization)

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob, WordCloud
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1. Campus Performance Heatmap
We calculated the average scores across all feedback categories to establish a high-integrity baseline for statistical analysis.

### 2. Consistency of Student Ratings
Using **Box Plots**, we analyzed the distribution and variance of ratings. This helps identify whether student opinions are unified or widely polarized in specific areas like "Assignments" or "Doubt Solving."

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Summary
Students were categorized into **Positive, Neutral, and Negative** groups based on their recommendation scores. 
* **Finding:** While a majority of the student body is positive, a significant segment remains critical of current event structures and course pacing.

### 4. Correlation: What Drives Recommendations?
The Correlation Heatmap identified the mathematical relationship between specific factors and the overall student recommendation.
> **Highlight:** The analysis suggests that **Interactivity** and **Doubt Solving** are primary drivers of student satisfaction.

### 5. Common Themes (Word Cloud)
We generated a Word Cloud to visualize the most frequent descriptors used in student feedback.

##  Recommendations
Based on the data, campus organizers should prioritize:
1.  **Restructuring Assignments:** This area consistently received lower-than-average scores.
2.  **Enhancing Support Systems:** Improving the "Support" and "Doubt Solving" metrics will have the highest impact on converting "Neutral" feedback into "Positive" recommendations.
3.  **Refining Course Structure:** Addressing the "Slow" or "Confusing" aspects identified in the sentiment analysis.
